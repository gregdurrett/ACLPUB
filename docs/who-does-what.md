title: Who does what?

Your responsibility as a publication chair is to ensure that the
proceedings of ACL and all of its associated events are prepared
correctly, uploaded to the local website for your ACL, and archived at
the Anthology.  You interact with other people in the following ways.

* The **general chair** is the person who first asked you to be a
  publication chair.  They are responsible for the overall success of
  the conference, so if you are ever uncertain about a decision, it is
  good style to run it by the general chair first -- especially if you
  are deviating from they way it was done before, or anticipate that
  others might not agree with you.

* You will frequently coordinate with the **program chairs**.  You will
  need to coordinate the time you get for preparing the proceedings
  with their decisions regarding the camera-ready deadline and the
  time when they make the schedule for the conference. They will also
  set up the START system in which you do most of your work, make
  decisions about page limits for papers, and so on.
  
* The job of the **local chairs** includes the website for the
  conference, to which you will eventually contribute the proceedings
  package that is still called "[CD-ROM]({{ site.baseurl }}/cdrom.html)" for historical
  reasons.  The local chairs are also responsible for preparing the
  conference handbook.  The handbook includes the schedule of talks
  and abstracts for all the papers, and you will therefore coordinate
  with the local handbook person to contribute these.  The local
  chairs may also have artwork for that year's conference produced,
  which you may want to share as the cover page for the proceedings.
  
* The *student chairs*, *demo chairs*, *tutorial chairs*, and the
  chairs of the individual *workshops* and co-located conferences each
  produce a separate volume of the proceedings ("books").  These
  people are collective known as the **book chairs**, and your sanity in
  the weeks before the conference will depend very heavily on how well
  you manage their work.  Each book chair is responsible for preparing
  their own book, but you are responsible for making sure that their
  books are produced correctly.  So there will be intense interaction.
  
* There are also *workshop chairs* for the whole conference, who
  organize the work of the chairs of the individual workshops.  Their
  work centers around the selection of the workshops, and is therefore
  finished long before yours really starts.  Your primary interaction
  with them is to set the camera-ready deadline for the workshops.
  
* The director of the *ACL Anthology* is in charge of maintaining the
  [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org).  They will assign you
  Anthology identifiers for all the books in your conference, which
  you will then pass on to the individual book chairs.  They will also
  eventually ask you for the complete proceedings of all the books
  together so they can upload them to the Anthology.
  Information on this process can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/info/contrib/).
  
* *Priscilla Rasmussen* is the person to go to when nobody else can
   help.  One item that is specifically her job is to obtain ISBN
   numbers for all the books once you ask her.
   
* The people at *Softconf* (the company that runs the START system)
  will be your best friends throughout the publication process. START,
  and the version of the [ACLPUB]({{ site.baseurl }}/aclpub.html)
  system inside of it, are battle-tested pieces of software, but
  things still go wrong.  In these cases, Rich Gerber and his
  colleagues are amazingly willing to help.
